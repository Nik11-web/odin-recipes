        <p><strong>Pizza</strong>, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ cup fat-free milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir in milk and olive oil until a soft dough forms. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10 times. Shape dough into a ball; cover with an inverted bowl and let sit for 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle on a baking sheet.</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake crust in preheated oven for 8 minutes; top with your favorite toppings and bake until crust is golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
