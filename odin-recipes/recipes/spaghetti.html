        <p><strong>Spaghetti</strong> is a genus of long, thin pasta, the basis of traditional Italian cuisine. In the Polish language, the word is sometimes also used to refer to the pasta. I think that It's very tasty in my opinion.</p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ¾ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef or a mixture of pork, veal, and beef (meat-loaf mix)</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>crushed red pepper (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt; cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Add Italian seasoning and 1 teaspoon garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add ground meat mix and 1 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring occasionally to crumble, until well browned and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Add marinara sauce and basil; cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>

            <li>Transfer pasta and cream mixture to a greased 13x 9 baking dish; toss gently to combine. Spread meat sauce evenly over pasta and sprinkle with mozzarella and crushed red pepper, if desired.</li>

            <li>Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and mozzarella is lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
